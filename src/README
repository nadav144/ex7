== Design Description ==
there are three sub packages in the project:
1. Commands - contains classes that handle command file such as parser and section.
2. Filters = Contains all the filters in the projects, Factory and related exceptions.
3. Orders - Contains all the orders in the project, Factory and replate exceptions.

Main excpetion types, and the main Manager and executer, MyFileScript classes can be found under the main package.

the design of the project is as given in class. it contains a main manager that impliments all the main logic and
execution of command files. contains parser and factory as in the Factory design pattern to read and parse the command
files.

it was importent to keep the parser as the sole part of the project who is taking part in the file format. each one is
aware of the relevant parts to him only. for example, each filter is inchange to parse the parameter him self, as he
see fit, and throw exception if needed.

all filters implements IFilter, who has a main method (does file pass filter) and all orders implement IOrder.

Order execution is beeing done using Arrays, and the defult sort method. each order is implementing Comparator<File> so
we can use the out of the box sort method. plus, this leaves the order to handle the specific order concept only
and not other sort mechanizem.

Exception were catched and handled where they needed:
- Filter and Order creation order handled by the parser since he is incharge of building the section from the file. the
    parser would create the defualt filter or order in case of an exception. plus, he will register the warning of the
    specific section.
- Catastrophic Errors were handled by the manager or the main. and would cuased the program to exit.
